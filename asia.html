        <div class="content-block-title">ISNCSCI 2019 Revisions - The ‘*’ Concept</div>
        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Before, “5*” was used when full muscle strength could not be achieved due to what the examiner believes to be a non-SCI condition. Now, a general ‘*’-concept is introduced, where all abnormal exam scores can be tagged with a ‘*’ to indicate a non-SCI condition impacts exam results. This general ‘*’-concept is applicable to motor scores of 0-4 and NT as well as to sensory scores of 0, 1 or NT, independent from the level of occurrence (above, at or below the sensory/motor level). </p>
          <p>While ‘*’-tagged scores above the sensory/motor level will in most cases be handled as normal during classification, ‘*’-tagged scores <span style="font-weight: bold">at or below the motor/sensory level</span> indicating a non-SCI related impairment superimposed to deficits caused by SCI will typically be handled as <span style="font-weight: bold">not normal.</span> </p>
          <p> With this new non-SCI taxonomy, motor and sensory sum scores are always calculated on the basis of the examined scores. As in the past, if key muscles or dermatomes cannot be tested (‘NT’), <span style="font-weight: bold">the sum score is not defined, and should be noted as ‘ND’.</span> </p>

        <div class="content-block-inner">
          <p>Before, ZPPs were only defined for complete (AIS A) injuries with no sensorimotor function in the most caudal sacral segments.</p>
          <p>Motor ZPPs should now be documented in <span style="font-weight: bold">incomplete injuries with absent VAC.</span> Sensory ZPP on <span style="font-weight: bold">each side (L/R)</span> is now defined in the <span style="font-weight: bold">absence of sensory function in S4-5</span> (LT, PP) <span style="font-weight: bold">on that side</span> as long as <span style="font-weight: bold">DAP is not present.</span> This means that in cases with present DAP, sensory ZPPs on both sides are not defined and should be noted as “not applicable (N/A)”. In cases with absent DAP, a sensory ZPP can be defined on one side (e.g., L) , while it may not necessarily be applicable on the other side (e.g., R).</p>
          <p>In complete (AIS A) injuries, the new ZPP definition is still fully compatible with the former definition and does not lead to different classification results</p>
          <p>Generally, non-key muscles are not used for the definition of the motor ZPP with one exception: <span style="font-weight: bold"> if preserved function of a non-key muscle more than 3 segments below the motor level leads to an AIS C grade of an otherwise AIS B graded subject without VAC,</span> the innervation of this non-key muscle determines the motor ZPP on this side.</p>
